# Release notes

TextReplacementView will use semver after 1.0.



## 0.3

This version makes it possible to render a `Text` with `TextComponent` values.

### âœ¨ Features

* `Text` has two new `TextComponent` initializers (functions).
* `TextComponent` is a new enum that defines `text` and `link` values.
* `TextComponent.LinkStyle` is a new value that can style `TextComponent.link`s.
* `View` has a new `textLinkStyle(...)` modifier that can be used to apply a link style.



## 0.2

Ok, never before has an assumption so quickly become incorrect as in this case. A few hours after the 0.1, [@kevinrpb](https://github.com/kevinrpb) suggested a change that will not only make this library a million times (ish) better, but it also calls for a project name change. 
 
The change is that this version replaces the `TextReplacementView` with `Text` initializers. This is SO much better, since it places the logic where it's expected. I first considered keeping the view as well, but I think it will just be confusing. 

As a result of this change, this project will be renamed from `TextReplacementView` to `TextReplacements`, which aligns much better with the new design.

Thank you Kevin for suggesting this change! 



## 0.1

This is the first version of TextReplacementView.

Since this view will most likely not change that much in the future, this *could* very well be the first and only version. In that case, it will be promoted to a `1.0` later this year.
